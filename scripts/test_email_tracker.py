test_email_tracker.py — Test email status updates against existing applications
================================================================================
LEARNING NOTE — Why test the tracker in isolation?

Before wiring the full Gmail hook → tracker → sheets pipeline, this script
lets you test the tracker agent logic directly. It simulates what happens when
the on_email_received hook passes a classified email to agents/tracker.md.

This script does NOT call Gmail. Instead it:
  1. Shows your 19 active "Applied" entries (imported from Excel)
  2. Lets you simulate an incoming email for any of them
  3. Runs the same matching + status update logic the tracker agent uses
  4. Writes the result to job_tracker.json (real write, not a dry-run)
  5. Syncs to Google Sheets if configured

This confirms the tracker logic works BEFORE you connect Gmail.
After confirming, run the real backfill:
  claude "check email all"

Usage:
  python3 scripts/test_email_tracker.py          ← interactive mode
  python3 scripts/test_email_tracker.py --dry    ← show active entries, no writes

# ── Claude API email classifier ───────────────────────────────────────────────
CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """You are classifying a recruiter email for a job application tracker.

Given the email subject and body, determine:
1. status: What is the application status this email signals?
2. is_job_related: Is this email about a job application at all?
3. tracking_url: Any application tracking URL in the body (null if none)
4. notes: Brief reason for your classification (1 sentence)

Valid status values (choose exactly one):
- "Applied"             — confirmation that application was received
- "Under Review"        — actively being considered, shortlisted, progressing
- "Interview Scheduled" — invited to interview or call
- "Assessment"          — asked to complete a test, task, or assessment
- "Offer Received"      — job offer extended
- "Rejected"            — application unsuccessful, not progressing
- "Not Relevant"        — not a job application email (newsletter, spam, etc.)

IMPORTANT:
- Recruiters write in many ways. Focus on INTENT not exact words.
- "We've reviewed your profile and..." followed by next steps = Under Review
- "Regret to inform", "on this occasion", "position has been filled" = Rejected
- "Would love to chat", "quick call", "speak with you" = Interview Scheduled
- Any form of test, task, case study, coding challenge = Assessment
- Thank you for applying / we have received = Applied
- If genuinely ambiguous between two statuses, pick the more advanced one

Also extract these fields to help match this email to the right application:
- company_name: The employer name exactly as written in this email (not normalised), or null
- role_title: The job title exactly as written in this email, or null
- job_reference_id: Any application or job reference/ID number (e.g. "210696379", "REF-12345"), or null

IMPORTANT FOR OUTPUT:
- notes: Write your own brief reason in max 10 words. Do NOT copy or quote text from the email.
- Keep the entire JSON response under 200 characters total.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no markdown, no explanation:
{
  "is_job_related": true/false,
  "status": "<one of the valid values above>",
  "tracking_url": "<url string or null>",
  "notes": "<brief reason>",
  "company_name": "<employer name as written, or null>",
